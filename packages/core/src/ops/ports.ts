/**
 * Everything the operator commands can reach.
 *
 * Two interfaces, split by whether the thing is guild-scoped:
 *
 * - `OpsPorts` — guild-scoped. Every member is supplied by the composition root
 *   as a closure over one `GuildScope`, so there is no parameter through which
 *   a command could name a different guild (`CLAUDE.md` rule 2). The split is
 *   the point: "does every query take a guild id" is answered by *which
 *   interface it is on*, not by reading each signature.
 * - `OpsInstance` — process-level. Uptime, the gateway connection, the
 *   configured mode. None of it is a query against guild data.
 *
 * Both grow one slice at a time, like `PanelStore` and `LoggingPorts` before
 * them.
